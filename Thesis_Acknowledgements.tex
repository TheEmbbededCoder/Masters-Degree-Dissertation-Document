I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my mentors and thesis supervisors, Professor Nuno Roma and Professor Pedro Tomás, for all the discussions about computer hardware, for always setting the bar high and for all their helpful insight and guidance through the development of the work presented in this thesis. Furthermore, I would like to thank INESC-ID for providing me the tools to develop the experimental results for this dissertation.

First, I must thank my grandfathers Filipe and António, my uncle João and my father for always inspiring me to get my "hands dirty" and be practical and objective when trying to solve a problem.

I would also like to thank my dear friends André Meneses, André Pereira, Edgar, Gonçalo, Ivan, Pedro and Rodrigo for all the good times that we spent, and for each of them always having an interesting and different topic to talk about.

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my family, who always believed in me, especially: 
to my sister, Rita, for all the insightful conversations and especially, for all the bits of advice about really everything that I need;
to my parents, for all the love, support, care, attention and opportunities that you provide me;
and to my girlfriend, Margarida, for tickling me on her unique way to aspire higher.

I've got a sense that all of you build a little bit of a stepping stone on which I can climb to look further ahead.
